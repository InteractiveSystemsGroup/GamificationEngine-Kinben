      <td>  The marketplace gives players the opportunity to offer tasks that have to be completed by their colleagues
so that they are able to fulfil those tasks and obtain the respective reward. Upon creation of a task, an
initial bid in terms of coins is set, which will be obtained as additional reward. Via Bids this initial bid
can be raised. To be able to create offers, a marketplace for the organisation is needed. If none exists yet,
it first has to be created.

If an offer is created an initial bid in terms of coins is set which is obtained by the person who completes
it. The initial bid can be raised by other colleagues in order to increase the incentive of fulfilling the
task. When a player has completed a Task that belongs to an offer, she/he will obtain all bids as a reward.
The particular task is then also added to the player’s list of the finished tasks. All offers a player has
put on the marketplace can be requested. The name of an offer can be changed at a later point of time as
well as the optional date when an offer ends or the deadline when the associated task of an offer should be
done at the latest.

At the marketplace not all offers may are visible for each player because the offers can be filtered by the
roles a player has. It can also additionally filtered by the date an offer was created or the prize which
can be earned. By making a bid, the reward of coins for completing a task is raised. The bidden amount of
coins will be subtracted from the bidder’s current account and will be added to the offer’s current prize.
Each player can make several bids on condition that her/his coins are enough otherwise the bid cannot be
made. It is also possible to get all bids that was made for an offer.

a level is set to "0". These can be raised by fulfilling tasks in the gamification application. Furthermore
a player can have an avatar, by specifying the path of an image previously uploaded to a server.
A player can be set active or can be deactivated so that she/he cannot complete tasks. In addition to create

associated id or all players of the organisation. The avatar of one player can also be requested. To display
the status of a player ancillary the already finished goals and finished tasks it can be requested all earned
permanent rewards. If only one status element is needed, the current points, coins, badges or achievements
can be gotten instead.
Each player can also have a list of contacts which represent other players in the same organisation, so players
can send them little presents.
